<h1>The Flow Language</h1>

The Flow programming language is a language for manipulating time series data as stored in the DIME
time series database. It has core functionality for working with data that varies over time that
makes it easy to work with to accomplish specific tasks as well as complicated enough to perform
advanced analysis.

It is a strict, strongly-typed, functional language (with side effects) based off of the syntax (and
a bit of the design) of Haskell. It is a high-level language, hiding the internal details of how
DIME manages the time series data. It also emphasizes the principle of DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
which means there should only be one preferred way of doing things. It is a dynamically-typed
language, deferring type checking to runtime, rather than enforcing type constraints during compile
time. The following is a (hopefully) complete specification of the language syntax and semantics. It
is not, however, a full specification of the variety of modules and functions that can also be used
in a Flow program. For more information on these, visit FlowBase.

<h2>Comments</h2>

Comments in flow are written the same way as Haskell

<pre><code>
-- This is a single line comment
{--
    This is a multiline comment
--}</code></pre>

Here is a quick shortcut that is useful when debugging Flow programs

<pre><code>
{--}
This line is can be commented out by removing the } in the previous line.
--}</code></pre>

<h2>Datatypes</h2> As a strongly-typed language, Flow will not do implicit conversions for
you. However, it is not a statically type-checked language, which means that it will only complain
about type errors during run-time. It is useful to understand how Flow denotes types, so that you
can enforce type constraints as soon as they become meaningful, and hence catch errors as quickly as
possible. All data types must start with capital letters, this is to help the compiler distinguish
data type names from type variables in function signatures.

The following types are builtin to Flow:

<ul>
  <li><code>Integer</code></li>
  <li><code>Boolean</code></li>
  <li><code>String</code></li>
  <li><code>Double</code></li>
  <li><code>Duration</code></li>
  <li><code>DateTime</code></li>
  <li><code>TimeSeriesCollection <span class="type-var">a</span></code></li>
  <li><code>TimeSeries <span class="type-var">dt</span> <span class="type-var">a</span></code></li>
  <li>Functions</li>
</ul>

Flow does not currently have any support for user-defined data types.

The syntax <code>a :: Type</code> is an assertion that the value <code>a</code> has type
<code>Type</code>. These assertions can occur anywhere in the code surrounded by parentheses, and
evaluate to the value of <code>a</code>. They can also occur in the declaration part of a
<code>let</code> expression, without parentheses.

<h3><code>Integer</code></h3>

The <code>Integer</code> type represents a 64-bit twos-complement integer. The following are all examples of
values of the <code>Integer</code> type:

<pre><code>I42
I-45
I1
I0</code></pre>

Note that all integers must be prefixed with the I character; otherwise, they will be interpreted as <code>Double</code>s.

<h3><code>Boolean</code></h3>

A <code>Boolean</code> represents a boolean value. It can only take on two values <code>True</code>
and <code>False</code>.

<h3><code>String</code></h3>

A <code>String</code> is a sequence of UTF-8 characters. Unlike Haskell, in Flow, String is not a specific
instance of the list class, it is its own type. A <code>String</code> literal is written in Flow by
surrounding a sequence of characters with double or single quotes. Multiline strings can be written
as in python using either triple double or triple single-quotes. The following are examples of
strings

<pre><code>'Hello, "world"!'
"Hello, 'world'!"
"""
This is  a multiline string surrounded by triple "s. It can contain
as many lines as you'd like and can contain both single quotes and sequences of less than three
double quotes. Sequences of " longer than three can be escaped like so \"\"\"\"\"\".
"""
'''An example of a multiline string surrounded by single quotes. The same rules
apply to these strings as triple quoted " strings, with the exceptions for " now applying to '
'''</code></pre>

Special characters in strings can be escaped according to the table below
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Escape code</th>
    <th>Character(or description)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\"</td>
    <td>"</td
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\'</td>
    <td>'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\t</td>
    <td>TAB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\n</td>
    <td>NEWLINE</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\r</td>
    <td>CARRIAGE RETURN</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\xNNNN</td>
    <td>Unicode character with hexadecimal representation NNNN</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\XNNNNNNNN</td>
    <td>Unicode character with hexadeimcal representation NNNNNNNN</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3><code>Double</code></h3>

A double-precision floating point number, according to the IEE 754 standard. All non-prefixed
numeric literals in Flow are automatically <code>Double</code>s. The following are examples of <code>Double</code> literals.

<pre><code>5
0.
524.
0.2415
0.4352
.534
242.1231
-4
-4.
-125.12
-.214
-0.241</code></pre>

<h3><code>Duration</code></h3>

A <code>Duration</code> represents an amount of time. Internally, it is stored as the number of
milliseconds between two events. Examples (and non-examples) of <code>Duration</code> literals are

<pre><code>16d -- 16 days
9ms -- 9 milliseconds
16d9ms -- 16 days, 9 milliseconds
5s -- 5 seconds
9ms16d -- non-example, units of greater magnitude must come first.
-16d -- 16 days ago</code></pre>

In general, the format for a <code>Duration</code> literal is
<code>[-][<i>N</i>Y][<i>N</i>M][<i>N</i>D][<i>N</i>h][<i>N</i>m][<i>N</i>s][<i>N</i>ms]</code> where
<i>N</i> represent arbitrary non-negative numbers and at least one of these need to be specified.

<h3><code>DateTime</code></h3>

A <code>DateTime</code> represents a specific point in time. It has millisecond level precision. It
is specified by prefixing a value in the <code>%Y-%m-%d+%H:%M:%S.%MS</code> format with the @
sign. Thus, the following are examples of <code>DateTime</code> objects:

<pre><code>@2012-01-21+17:01:54.121 -- 21 January 2012 at 5:01:54.121 PM</pre></code>

All fields of a <code>DateTime</code> object must be given.

<h3><code>TimeSeriesCollection <span class="type-var">a</span></code></h3>

A <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> is a collection of similarly aligned time series. The alignment
of the time series is given as a <em>type variable,</em> which allows the type system to enforce
rules on alignment. <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> objects can only be referred to; you cannot
write a <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> literal in the code. However, you can refer to any DIME
TimeSeries as a <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> by prefixing the name of the time series with the
# character. So, for example, the following all <em>evaluate</em> to <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code>
objects (assuming the appropriate time series exist).

<pre><code>#AAPL
#MSFT</code></pre>

Please note, that, since these are references not values, evaluating these may cause runtime errors
if the appropriately named time series cannot be found.

You can also get a reference to a DIME time series whose name you only know at runtime (in the form
of a <code>String</code>). To lookup a time series, use the <code>timeSeries</code> function, as
below, where <code>seriesName</code> is the name of a series you'd like to lookup.

<pre><code>timeSeries seriesName
timeSeries "AAPL" -- Equivalent to #AAPL</code></pre>

<code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> objects have a few properties. These properties can be retrieved
using accessor functions, which, unlike most Flow functions, can be written after the
<code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> objects, and with no separating whitespace. The table below
summarizes the fields on a <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> object.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Accessor</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Field Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.name</code></td>
    <td><code>String</code></td>
    <td>The name of the time series collection (i.e. <code>#AAPL.name</code> is <code>"AAPL"</code>).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.tableId</code></td>
    <td><code>Integer</code></td>
    <td>The numeric table ID assigned to this time series, by the DIME runtime. A negative value
      indicates a temporary <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.length</code></td>
    <td><code>Integer</code></td>
    <td>The number of samples in this time series</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.startTime</code></td>
    <td><code>DateTime</code></td>
    <td>The time at which this time series started being recorded</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.dataFrequency</code></td>
    <td><code>Duration</code></td>
    <td>The time in between two successive samples</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following are both valid ways to extract the <code>.dataFrequency</code> field from a
<code>TimeSeriesCollection</code>

<pre><code>#AAPL.dataFrequency -- specialized syntax
(.dataFrequency) #AAPL -- regular function application syntax</code></pre>

In addition to these field accessors, <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> objects also have
<em>column</em> accessors. These are used to extract the individual <code>TimeSeries</code> out of
the collection. These accessors can also be used to create subcollections. These accessors are
prefixed with a colon. Here are a few examples:

<pre><code>#AAPL:price -- the price time series of the #AAPL TimeSeriesCollection
#AAPL:price:pe -- a new TimeSeriesCollection containing the price and P/E ratio of #AAPL</code></pre>

<h3><code>TimeSeries <span class="type-var">d</span> <span class="type-var">a</span></code></h3>

A <code>TimeSeries</code> is a mapping of <code>DateTime</code> objects to values of the type given
by the type variable <span class="type-var">d</span>. In this case, <span class="type-var">d</span>
must be a <em>primitive type</em>, which is one of <code>Integer</code>, <code>String</code>, or
<code>Double</code> (basically any datatype that can be stored in a DIME column). Like
<code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> objecs, <code>TimeSeries</code> also include an alignment in their
type signature, to facilitate with alignment checking. The alignment parameter is copied over when a
<code>TimeSeries</code> is extracted from a <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> object. That is,
suppose
<pre><code>#AAPL :: TimeSeriesCollection 60.</code></pre>
Then,
<pre><code>#AAPL:price :: TimeSeries Double 60,</code></pre>
assuming that <code>price</code> is a DIME column with type <code>Double</code>.

Like <code>TimeSeriesCollection</code> objects, <code>TimeSeries</code> also have fields that can be
accessed with accessor functions. The following table summarizes these fields.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Accessor</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Field Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.name</code></td>
    <td><code>String</code></td>
    <td>The name of the time series.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.columnId</code></td>
    <td><code>Integer</code></td>
    <td>The DIME column ID corresponding to this time series (a negative value indicates that this
  is a temporary series) </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Functions</h3>

As a functional programming language, Flow follows the Haskell convention for denoting the types of
functions.

The basic constructor for a function type in Flow is <code>a -&gt; b</code> which designates a
function from type <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>. Like in Haskell, Flow functions can return
functions. This means that a multi-argument function type can be written as

<pre><code>timeDiff :: DateTime -> DateTime -> Duration</code></pre>

This is a function that takes in two <code>DateTime</code> objects and returns their difference as a
<code>Duration</code>. It can be invoked as such (assuming <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are two
<code>DateTime</code> values).

<pre><code>timeDiff a b :: Duration</code></pre>

Note that the <code> :: Duration</code> part isn't necessary and is only their to clarify the type
of the <code>timeDiff a b</code> expression.

Like Haskell, functions can be curried (i.e., you don't need to apply a function to all its
arguments at once).

<pre><code>timeDiff a :: DateTime -> Duration</code></pre>

As a functional language, Flow allows you to use this to define your own functions. So, for example,
a more complicated way to write <code>timeDiff a b</code> is as follows (this is just for
illustrative purposes, do not write code like this!).

<pre><code>let partialDiff = timeDiff a
in partialDiff b</code></pre>

<h2>Program structure</h2>
A Flow program is an import list, followed by a single expression. The value of this single
expression is the result of the program.

<h3>Import expressions</h3>

Import expressions can be used to bring in functions from external libraries. Like Haskell, once a
module is imported, all its functions are visible in the current scope. Note that, like Haskell, all
module names are capitalized. Again like Haskell, you can import modules qualified, which means that
functions within that module must be fully qualified (i.e. must be prefixed with the name of the
module, followed by a `.'). Suppose there is a module <code>A.B.C</code> containing function
<code>f</code>. The following examples is an exhaustive list of the ways you can access <code>f</code>.

<pre><code>import A.B.C

f -- works, and returns the value of f, since it has been brought into scope with the import statement above</code></pre>

<pre><code>import qualified A.B.C

f -- doesn't work, since the qualified import has <em>not</em> brought the f function into scope</code></pre>

<pre><code>import qualified A.B.C

A.B.C.f -- works, because we're using the fully qualified name of f</code></pre>

<pre><code>import qualified A.B.C as M

A.B.C.f -- does not work, since A.B.C is not the name of any module (it has been renamed to M in the
        -- current scope</code></pre>

<pre><code>import qualified A.B.C as M

M.f -- works because it uses the fully qualified name of f (which has been put into module M) by the
    -- import qualified</code></pre>

<pre><code>import A.B.C

A.B.C.f -- works, because you can always use the fully qualified name, even without an import
        -- qualified</code></pre>

<pre><code>import A.B.C as M

A.B.C.f -- does not work, since A.B.C is not the name of a module (it was renamed to M by the as
        -- declaration)</code></pre>

<pre><code>import A.B.C as M

M.f -- works because f is in the M module and you can always use fully qualified names</code></pre>

<h3>Expressions</h3>

There are three types of expressions in Flow: (a) a literal, (b) a function application, or (c) a
<code>let-in</code> construct. Note that, unlike Haskell, constructs such as <code>if-then-else</code>
are implemented via functions and constructs such as <code>case-of</code> are unnecessary, since we
disallow algebraic data types. We have already discussed literals in the first part of this
manual. We will now discuss function application and the <code>let-in</code> construct.

<h2>Function application</h2>

As a functional language, the topic of function application in Flow is a pretty big one. In Flow,
like in Haskell, function application is denoted by putting the names of the arguments right after
the name of the function and separating them with spaces. Thus, we can call the function
<code>f</code> with arguments <code>x</code> and <code>#AAPL</code> with the code
<pre><code>f x #AAPL</code></pre>

Functions can also return other functions. As we saw in the section on function types, all multi
argument functions are indeed functions that return other functions. So, we can write the piece of
code above in a more convoluted fashion:
<pre><code>(f x) #AAPL</code></pre>

Although convoluted, this example is a good illustration of the fact that Flow applies arguments one
at a time, from left to right.

It may be the case that we want to pass the result of a function as the second argument to
<code>f</code> (perhaps we want to look up a time series by name). In that case, the following will
<em>not</em> work.
<pre><code>f x timeSeries "AAPL"</code></pre>
The Flow system will interpret this as trying to call the <code>f</code> function with the arguments
<code>x</code>, <code>timeSeries</code>, and <code>"AAPL"</code>. What we need is a construct that
we can use to somehow "group" together the <code>timeSeries "AAPL"</code> expression. Luckily, we
can use parentheses for this. Thus, the following works
<pre><code>f x (timeSeries "AAPL")</code></pre>

Some functions are special, in that they can be written in between other expressions. These
functions are known as binary operators, and include operations such as addition, subtraction,
division, multiplication, modulo, exponentiation, etc. Unlike Haskell, Flow does not let the user
define such functions. These functions are built-in to the system itself. They follow all the
standard rules of arithmetic. Examples of these operators are given below

<pre><code>5 + 5
5 / 5
125 % 15 -- modulo
9 ** 2 -- exponentiation
6 & 6 -- bitwise AND
True && False -- logical AND
5 == 1 -- equivalence check</code></pre>

Note, that there is no symbolic unary negation operator. To negatve the value of a variable, use the
<code>negate</code> function.
<pre><code>negate 5 -- Same thing as -5
negate I5 -- Same thing as I-5</code></pre>
As demonstrated above, the type of <code>negate</code> is polymorphic, meaning that it accepts all
types for which it makes sense. In fact, when we come to the section on <code>TimeSeries</code>
manipulation, we'll see just how powerful this polymorphism is.

The table below is an exhaustive list of binary operators, their expected types and their return
types.

<pre><code>TODO: Make the list</code></pre>

<h2><code>Let-in</code> expressions</h2>

So far we have written expressions in just one-single line. Although it is possible to write every
Flow expression in a single line, for the sake of readability, it is useful to give names to complex
expressions or to expressions that will be reused. It is also much easier to use recursion when
there is some mechanisms for naming expressions (although, it is certainly possible to use recursion
without such a mechanism... search Google for Y fixed point operator). The <code>let-in</code>
expression lets us name expressions and then reuse them later on

The basic syntax for a <code>let-in</code> expression is as follows
<pre><code>let {
    value1 = expr1;
    value2 = expr2;
    value3 :: Type;
    value3 = value3;

    f :: Type1 -> Type2;
    f x = ...;
    .
    .
} in expression</code></pre>

The names bound in the declaration part of the <code>let-in</code> can be used both from within the
declaration part and from the <code>in</code> part. The <code>let-in</code> clause evaluates to the
value of the <code>in</code> expression. Not all expressions in the declaration part must be
used. In fact, the following is perfectly valid
<pre><code>let { value1 = extremely hard to compute value }
in 5</code></pre>
This code will evaluate to 5. Note that the computation of <code>value1</code> might be optimized
away by the compiler. This is an important point, as it affects the semantics of programs, if the
functions in question have side effects. In order to ensure that functions are evaluated, you must
mention them in the body of the clause (the part after the <code>in</code> keyword).

Finally, note that <code>let-in</code> serves another purpose. It is the gateway into the world of
side effects. That is, the body of the <code>let-in</code> clause can actually contain multiple
expressions, separated by commas. The final value of the clause is the value of the final
expression, but the other expressions will be fully evaluated, and any side effects caused by their
evaluation will occur. Thus, the actual general form for a <code>let-in</code> expression is
<pre><code>let {
    value1 = expr1;
    value2 = expr2;
    .
    .
} in {
    bodyexpr1;
    bodyexpr2;
    ...;
    bodyexprn
}</code></pre>
If only one expression will be used, you can omit the parentheses. This is the mechanism you'd use
to enforce that the values of certain expressions in the declaration part are indeed evaluated.
